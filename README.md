Character generation and storage for characters in 13th Age. Learning project. Uses [Tim Corey's C# course](https://youtu.be/wfWxdh-_k_4) for much of the initial design in desktop application.

## Roadmap
1. Create character sheet storage and retrieval
2. Add character generation (including randomisation)
3. Add in-game tools (e.g. roll for attacks, take damage, add XP)
